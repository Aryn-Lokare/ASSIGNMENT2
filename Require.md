A mini e-commerce web app inspired by Amazon. The project allows users to create, view, update, and delete products using a database. It also integrates the Gemini AI API to generate smart product descriptions from text prompts. Built with Next.js App Router, Prisma, Supabase, and styled using shadcn/ui

 Pages to Create:

- `/` – Show all products from the database.
- `/create` – Add new products (name, price, etc.).
- `/admin` (optional) – Update or delete products.

 Tech Stack:

- Prisma + Supabase for database interaction  
- Full CRUD operations  
- Use the Gemini API to generate a product description from a prompt  
  Example: “Write a cool description for iPhone 15”

 Important Note:

Don’t just generate random code using AI — make sure you connect it to the database properly and understand how each part works.  
If I see it’s not working or just surface-level AI output, it won’t be accepted.
